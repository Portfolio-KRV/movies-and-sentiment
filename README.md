# Movies and sentiment
Developed in the Introduction to Data Science course by: Kevin Reyes.
## Objectives
- Identify the positive or negative sentiment in movie reviews using machine learning methods and neural networks.
- Compare bag of words and tf-idf text vectorization methods.
- Analyze the effectiveness of the dropout method in the classification problem.
- Represent the texts using word embeddings.
- Apply T-SNE method to visualize the distribution of embeddings.
- Clustering the distribution of embeddings obtained with the T-SNE method.
- Evaluate the use of pre-trained embeddings.
## Description
Comparative study of machine learning methods and neural networks with different variations applied to the sentiment classification of movie opinions.

## Conclusions
- The application of dropout decreases the overfitting of neural networks.
- Networks with a larger number of LSTM cells increase the overfitting considerably.
- The data set presents an imbalance of only 2%, so we can speak of a balanced classification problem.
- By increasing the strength of regularization in traditional methods, we obtain greater generalization capacity.
- Machine learning models have fewer overfitting problems than neural network models.
